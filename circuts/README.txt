Notes:
* Cicrut don't work, transistors don't close, or open randomally.
 My leds eat over 300mA
 I use ULN2308L. ULN have 16 pins, I fix it: cut first 6 ping (1,2,3 and 16,15,14)
 (crystal is between on 4,5, 12,13 pins)
 I soldered it upside down to AVR controller and connect to LED output.

* I cut cicrut button, and issued outside.

Sorry for my fucking bad english.
